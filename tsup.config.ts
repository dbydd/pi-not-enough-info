	// `.js`/`.mjs` ESM files first and only applies its host aliases
	// (`@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent`, `@earendil-works/pi-tui` -> the running
	// Pi's own modules) when that native import fails. A `.js` entry next to a
	// resolvable `node_modules/@earendil-works/*` (a local checkout installed with
	// `pi install <dir>`, or any hoisted copy) therefore binds the extension to a
	// second copy of Pi, and every prototype patch lands on classes the TUI never
	// uses. jiti always transpiles `.ts`, so the aliases always apply and the
	// extension always patches the Pi that is actually running.
